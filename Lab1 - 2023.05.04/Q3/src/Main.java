//        3. A software object's behavior is exposed through methods
//        4. Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly accessible methods is known as Encapsulation.
//        5. A blueprint for a software object is called a class.
//        6. Common behavior can be defined in a superclass and inherited into a subclass using the extends keyword.
//        7. A collection of methods with no implementation is called an interface.
//        8. A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a package.
//        9. The term API stands for Application Programming Interface.
